      <h1>current language</h1>
      <p>ok so now that we got the previous languages out of the way lets rlly hone in on the current lingo. i would say it probs started around the early 2010s. where leet n lol speak were more niche and specific to ingroups the current language is more widespread extending to mainstream social media as well as meme culture and has a lot more grammatical specificity</p>
<p>john mcwhorter a well known linguist put forward the idea that texting n contemporary internet language is actually fingered speech. ik that sounds grody but it rlly means that the way we talk on the web is an attempt at mimicking the way we speak. (thats why its called webSPEAK not webwrite lol) through history speeches n formal talks have always been trying to imitate the way we write lk fuckin shakespeare it’s super fancy n lk no one actually knows what ppl r saying but since communication has been increasingly web oriented language has to catch up</p>
<p>grammar now is a way to communicate the subtleties of spoken word especially in the effort to make up for communication pieces we r missing thru the web fr ex factial expression n emphasis</p>
<h2>pieces</h2>
<p>so in this section of the book were gonna rlly break down the pieces of contemporary webspeak, what r the pieces, how do they work n how have they changed, what does it matter</p>
<p>it’s important to note the appropriation of contemporary grammar in webspeak, we’ll get into it w each component but be aware a lot of the subtlety of webspeak is in the collective reassignment of meaning in traditional grammar structures which have mostly been used to pace and structure a writing piece </p>
<h2>txt style</h2>
<p>current webspeak is probs most well known fr the truncation of words plus acronyms and abbreviations</p>
<p>these things aren’t lk New fr writing, but the cool thing abt the web is how many new ones have become a part of the vernacular as well as many r temporarily popular n later forgotten</p>
<p>webspeak is rlly influenced by the advent of texting on cell phones bc when texting first became accessible most ppl still had flip phones where it would b difficult to type out full words n sentences also the screen was small n texts had length caps n phone companies often charged by the letter</p>
<p>bc this form of communication was evolving simultaneously with communication on the web there was a lot of overlap and texting style basically became absorbed into webspeak</p>
<p>while there r a lot of different ways ppl can truncate words patterns have def emerged w what is considered appropriate</p>
<p>part of the reason letter dropping n truncation occurs is the casual tone that those phrases then convey bc when someone is comfortable enough to not b exactly proper it feels like more sociable n friendly</p>
<p>its easy 2 notice that mostly vowels r dropped when truncating but that’s not exclusively tru lk it’s more that the unnecessary letters r dropped lk thanks can become thx or ty bc u can still understand what they mean also altho this is less clearly defined many ppl have a noticeably different internal pronunciation fr truncated words than for their full spelling which is why u might find both the short n long form in the same sentence this is along the same lines as how truncation presents a more casual tone</p>
<h3>aside</h3>
<p>around 2005 or so i was in middle school cell phones were basically just becoming a Thing n i had some rlly crappy flip phone. i was immediately into textspeak first bc if was rlly hard to type on my flip phone. for a while lk most of high school i had this awful little blue brick with a full tiny keyboard. i had a p strict texting limit n my social interactions esp hang out planning were increasingly text based. my first ever relationship w a boy mostly occurred thru corny texts. i was rlly into textspeak to the point where i had some more prescriptivist friends who would make me resend a message spelled out traditionally. i def would go back n forth between more stylistic n more traditional grammar n i think my current text style is sort of an in between</p>
<h2>intentional typos</h2>
<p>so speaking of truncation n how it can b a style choice intentional misspelling has become a p big part of webspeak as well</p>
<p>we def see this in lolspeak and even in some parts of leetspeak but there is a lot more breadth and specificity in current webspeak</p>
<p>truncation has become a way fr ppl to mimic vocal tones so that intentionally diff spellings or misspellings have a diff connotation and feeling this is a relatively new thing n creates some generational gaps bc older ppl think that truncation is a result of bein rushed or lazy whereas younger ppl use it to communicate their tone</p>
<p>there have honestly been so many stylistic additions to webspeak just in ref to the acronyms n abbreviations it could probs b it’s own book (there r some in the glossary at the back of the book)</p>

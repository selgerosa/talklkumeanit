      <p>i og started writing this book to prove the opinions on webspeak i always have held n to find academic precedence n linguistic explanations fr each aspect of webspeak </p>
<p>webspeak is obv a constantly evolving language so the stuff covered in this book is just where we r now (plus some stuff stuff i didnt have the chance to cover) but i think its rlly important that we as a collective r thinkin critically abt webspeak bc the internet is currently a primary communication method n we dont stop to consider how webspeak affects this communication</p>
<p>ok so i promised i was gonna talk abt pet websites so here it is</p>
<p>it's embarrassing n fully a guilty pleasure of mine but i really love this shit lk yall remember neopets  it's lk that (altho neopets has been long dead) my fave site is subeta (i have had an account for almost 8 years lol) the basic premise is like an rpg style universe where u can dress up an avatar n do various quests n whatever</p>
<p>anyway i have a v casual acquaintanceship w a bunch of ppl on subeta (im part of their forum group n when i remember to i like to chat in there) so i decided to make a forum post to ask ppl abt how they use web lingo</p>
<p>some context u probs need:<p> -->
<!-- add text indent -->
<p>my user name is fungii<p>
<p>to the left is my initial post n the others r some of the responses</p>
<p>forums r this rlly specific place on the web where traditional grammar style is basically mandated. i would characterize it lk a business casual email so punctuation caps and spelling r all generally used altho there is the addition of imgs n gifs n the occasional emoji or acronym</p>
<p>it was rlly interesting to talk abt webspeak on a forum bc of this formality where lk we were all using traditional grammar structures but talkin abt if we use lol or nah also i got to hear from ppl from a few diff age groups (i talk regularly to someone w kids) n demographics i even got to talk about how webspeak is used in different languages </p>
<p>something interesting to note is one of the ppl who posted asserted a fear that emojis r takin over speech (prescriptivism lmao) n when met with a bit of backlash/ two ppl who disagreed w her, she deleted her post citing her being uncomfortable. but she then sent it to me thru smail which is a private mailing system on the site. this somehow feels completely in line w the culture of forums at least on this site, where while being super willing to help once challenged erasing any evidence, lk <p>she’s still wanted to talk to me but didn’t want to have her opinions public </p>
<p>i think this rlly speaks to a sort of formalization of anonymous culture on the web where opinions r divorced from self as an instinct to avoid disagreement</p>

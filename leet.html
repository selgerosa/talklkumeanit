  <p>so leet speak aka 1337 speak started around the 80s on early chat rooms which were called bulletin board systems. the basic idea is replacing letters w numbers or other characters</p>
<p>it isnt confirmed but ppl think it came about as a way fr hackers to prevent their posts from being found thru keyword searches</p>
<p>it got popular in the 90s on early online multiplayer games lk doom n took off from there</p>
<p>the idea is p straightforward but there were some grammar n phrase additions</p>
</p>
<h3>aside</h3>
<p>leet is a little bit b4 my time on the web bc im a Millennial so i didnt use computers until i was in middle school n by that time the web was in fully engulfed in the image macro style. that said leet still has ripples in web culture lk when i would go on pet websites (u will hear abt this later ok) items would often have references to leet either the word or the number version
</p>
<h2>grammar</h2>

<p>letter dropping / adding patterns and abbreviations have always been integral to webspeak and leet is no different in fact it’s basically the most important part of leet</p>
<p>it’s letter substitution was fundamental to leet’s grammar structure bc emphasis was usually indicated by how elaborate converted a sentence was</p>
<p>pictured are some of the most common letter conversions in leet although this is not by any means all of them as mentioned creativity and illegibility was a major to component to this style it’s also worth noting that certain letters having overlapping conversions which def makes translation more difficult and dependant on context</p>

<img src="leet_table_2.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>this is also the first time on the web where we see ‘teh’ the misspelling of ‘the’ being used (it was a big deal in lolspeak)</p>
<p>also common was the dropping of the ‘e’ in ‘-ed’ sometimes it would b replaced w an apostrophe instead lk owned becomes pwnd or pwn’d</p>
<p>new suffixes n new pairings started to surface which gave leet it’s well known sound</p>
<p>suffixes include ‘-ness’ ‘-age’ ‘-xor’ ex awesomeness pwnage haxor</p>
<p>also popular was replacing the long vowel sound for ‘o’ w 00 lk d00d (dude) or j00 (you)

<h2>legacy</h2>
<p>most of the phrases from leet speak have faded into the tapestry of the internet altho the trend of replacing letters fr numbers has come in n out of popularity since then
<p>leet still appears in pop culture fr ex being used in titles fr the show ‘mr robot’ which is abt hackers</p>
<p>a few of the phrases in leet also were assimilated into webspeak probably most notably noob which is still a v popular term for a new player in a video game</p>
